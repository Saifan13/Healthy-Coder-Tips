                <p>You don't have to take your kayak out onto the lake during your lunch break, but getting regular exercise is key to being a healthy coder.</p>
                <p>Take short breaks throughout your day to get up from your desk and stretch your muscles.  And when you sit back down, focus on maintaining good posture at your desk.</p>
                <p>During your lunch break, take a walk outside to get a change of scenery and improve your circulation.  This will help to improve your focus when you get back to your coding projects.</p>

                <p>Pack a healthy lunch or take a brisk walk to a local shop or grocery store to pick up a healthy meal.</p>
                <p>Choose fresh, healthy ingredients and stay away from processed foods.  Soup and sandwich or a salad with a bunch of tasty toppings always hits the spot for energy and nutrition.</p>
                <p>Keep healthy snacks at your desk within easy reach.  Carrot sticks or sliced apples with peanut butter are great.  Many coders enjoy trail-mix with raisins, nuts and seeds.  Make your own recipe to match your tastes.</p>

                <p>In Colorado's dry climate, it can be difficult to stay hydrated throughout the workday.</p>
                <p>That's why it's so important to be sure to drink plenty of water while you're busy coding.</p>
                <p>When choosing a beverage, remember that many caffeinated beverages like coffee and soda will actually dehydrate your mind and body.</p>  
                <p>Make water your go-to beverage and limit your intake of drinks that sap your vitality. </p>
